# Active Context

## Current Work
- Building the event aggregation application based on the project brief.
- Developing a responsive TypeScript/React frontend to allow users to submit their email and event URLs.
- Planning the backend modules for web scraping (using Puppeteer), AI-based parsing (leveraging OpenAI APIs for structured outputs), ICS file generation, and weekly email updates.

## Recent Changes
- Product context documented in cline_docs/productContext.md.
- Project brief reviewed and technical requirements extracted for both frontend and backend components.

## Next Steps
- Finalize the design for the event tables based on OpenAI's Structured Outputs guidelines.
- Set up the frontend project structure for deployment on Vercel.
- Architect the backend components, including:
  - Puppeteer-based web scraping.
  - AI integration for parsing and normalizing event data.
  - ICS file generation and hosting.
  - Scheduled email notifications.
- Begin creation of a minimal viable version of the frontend and backend, ensuring integration points for data flow.
